# SOR_Chebyshev-Accleration
This is a program to calculate the electric field and electric potential at all points within a cube or cuboid, as a result of any arbitrary charge configuration within the defined cube/cuboid enclosure. Currently, only the Z = 0 plane is given the flexibility to be considered as a perfect conductiong ground, but it can be easily extended to other boundary plnes too.

More details about improving SOR efficiency (reducing errors and improving speed of convergence) can be found in : Chapter 20 in the text " Numerical Recipes"
